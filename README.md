# HandWar

**HandWar** is a fast-paced, browser-based take on the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game.
Built as a lightweight prototype, it focuses on instant play, smooth animations, and quick matchmaking. Players can challenge friends or get paired with a random opponent in real time, make their move, and see the winner revealed instantly.

The project is designed to be **scalable** — starting with the original RPS set but structured so new themes, elements, or game modes can be added later without changing the core logic. It uses Firebase for real-time multiplayer and hosting, ensuring quick deployment and minimal backend setup.

**Core Features**

- Real-time 1v1 gameplay
- Simple, responsive UI
- Animated hand gestures for each choice
- Instant result calculation and display
- Quick matchmaking system

**Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** Vite + React + Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting (one-command deploy)
